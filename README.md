This project is a Dockerized Django application.

Steps are as follows:

Make sure DockerDesktop is running in the background.

run these:
    docker-compose build 
    docker-compose up

    the url is 'http://localhost:8000/memberships/login/' once it is up and running

    docker-compose down or control c in the cmd should terminate the process

    the app is fairly simple

    Thank you,
